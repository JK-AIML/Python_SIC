#when condition is met, how to repeat a certain code multiple times

while True: #condition
    print("yes") # executes this block while above is true
    #ctrl c to interupt
    break #exits the current (inner most/nested most/latest/most subset) loop when encountered
i = 0
while i == 0:
    print("a is zero")
    i = i + 1 #unlike for, body can change state of condition when it repeates

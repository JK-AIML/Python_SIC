#lists

#A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, ordered sequence of elements

#2. order
#The first item is at index 0, the second at 1, and so forth.

#3. hetero and homo type
# While Python lists are commonly homogeneous (storing elements of the same type, they can also hold mixed data types as well (heterogeneous).

#4. Dynamic Sizing
#Lists in Python do not need a predefined size, as they can grow and shrink dynamically.
data = [5, 6, 3, "hi"]  #index: 0,1,2,3
data = (5, 6, 3, "hi")
data = list(data)
print(data)

#traversing
print(data[1])

#slicing
a = data[0:3:1]     #start stop increment

#removing elements: del statement
l1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
del l1[2]
print(f"del: {l1}")

#References
#during mutables assignment, the nomal assignment copies the ref ID only, changes made to any element will reflect on all var having same references
#note: the nested data types have individual ref IDs
#the copy fn creates a shallow copy (only the first parent elements are copied, i.e, the nested datas have shared ref
#for copy the reference to the same inner list is shared.

l1 = [1,[2,3],3,4]
l2 = l1.copy()
l2[0] = 100
print(f"list l1: {l1}, id l1: {id(l1)}, id l2: {id(l2)}")   #the inner data ele is not changed so data changd is from parent branch -> not shared ref
l2[1][1] = 10
print(f"list l1: {l1}, id l1: {id(l1)}, id l2: {id(l2)}")

# len for no of total characters and index to get index of specified value
# Appending and extending: append(), extend() for adding elements.
# Inserting and removing: insert(), pop(), remove() for modifying list contents.
# Sorting and reversing: sort(), reverse() for ordering.
# count for counting no of the same ele

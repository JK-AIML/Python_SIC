#objects are real world maifestations of classes
#eg:
class hello:
    ...        #creating a statement that means the class deatails will be added later
var1 = hello()  #object var1 created from class hello

#technical term is instan-tiation of class is object
# another term for objects is instances

# technical term for attributes is instance variables
# called instance as the data stored is specific to that very object

var1.attribute1 = "hi"  #created a new attribute and at the same time assigned value "hi" to it

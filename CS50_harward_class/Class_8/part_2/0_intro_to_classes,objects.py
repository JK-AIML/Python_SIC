# we used data structures with predetermined relations like dict, to create them customly:
# we use classes
""" 
 Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
 Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Eg strings, functions, modules
 Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
 Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
 """
# In Python, an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data (attributes) and functionality (methods).
# Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, meaning everything in Python—numbers, strings, functions, and even modules—is represented as an object.
